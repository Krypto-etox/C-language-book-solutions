Throughout human history, people have tried to define intelligence several times.
Some people think about it as the capacity for logic, reasoning, or critical
thinking. Some people have stated that intelligence could be self-awareness,
emotional knowledge, or creativity. Other people think about intelligence as the
capacity for planning and problem-solving.

One could think about intelligence from a large diversity of perspectives.
Trying to define it is not the most simple type of problem that one could deal
with. It is natural to start asking some questions about this problem. Why is
intelligence so hard to define? What makes it that special? Is even possible to
define what it is?
